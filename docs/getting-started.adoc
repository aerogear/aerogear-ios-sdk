== Prerequisites

To get started with the AeroGear iOS SDK, you can set up the SDK in your existing or new project. The SDK is written in Swift. You can also link:./example-app-guide.adoc[run the example project] to see how the SDK works.

To use the AeroGear SDK for iOS, you will need the following installed on your development machine:

* iOS 9 or later
* Xcode 9 or later
* link:https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods]

=== CocoaPods

1) The AeroGear SDK for iOS is available using the CocoaPods package manager.
If you have not installed CocoaPods, install it by running the command:

[source,bash]
----
gem install cocoapods
pod setup
----

2) In your project directory (the directory where your `.xcodeproj` file is), create a plain text file named `Podfile` (without any file extension) and add the lines below. Replace `YourTarget` with your actual target name.

.Podfile
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target :'YourTarget' do
    ## Require one of the AeroGear Services here
    pod 'AeroGearServices/sync'
    pod 'AeroGearServices/core'
end
---- 

3) Then run the following command:
    
[source,bash]
----
pod install
----

4) Open up `.xcworkspace` with Xcode and start using the SDK.

> Do not use `.xcodeproj`. If you open up a project file instead of a workspace, dependencies will not be correctly configured.

== Getting Started with Swift

1) Import the Core service in the application .

[source,swift]
----
   import AeroGearServices/core
----

2) In the Swift file you want to use the SDK, import the appropriate library for the services you are using. The header file import convention is `import AeroGearServices/name`, as in the following examples:

[source,swift]
----
   import AeroGearServices/sync
----

3) Use imported service library

Please follow each individual service documentation for more information 
about usage.
