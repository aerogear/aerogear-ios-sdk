= Example project

**This project is used only for internal testing purposes**
See official documentation to see how to integrate SDK into your app.

== Prerequisites

An example project that makes use of the SDK has been provided in the `example` folder. This project is good for understanding how the SDK works.

You will need the following installed on your development machine:

* iOS 9 or later
* Xcode 9 or later
* link:https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods]

=== CocoaPods

1) The AeroGear Mobile SDK for iOS is available using CocoaPods package manager
If you have not installed CocoaPods, install it by running the command:

[source,bash]
----
gem install cocoapods
pod setup
----

2) In the `example` directory run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pod install
----

=== Run the Example App

3) Open the `AeroGearSdkExample.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and click the 'Build & Run' button in Xcode. This should start the example application in an emulator.

> Do not use `.xcodeproj`. If you open up a project file instead of a workspace, dependencies will not be correctly configured.

=== Notes About the Example Project

It is important to note that the example SDK is using relative import statements to import the SDK code. You can see this in `example/Podfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
pod 'AGSCore', :path => '../modules/core'
----

In the Xcode workspace, you will see a file explorer similar to that below:

Under `Pods` > `Development Pods` you will find the Core and the Metrics SDKs.
